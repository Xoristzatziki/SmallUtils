# SmallUtils
Gui for some utils.

# Remove .DS_Store file in given directory and in all its subdirectories.
Every time I extract a zip created in MAC my disk is "polluted" with .DS_Store files. This is an easy way to remove them instead of trying to remember the exact bash commands.

# Remove execute permissions from files in a given directory and in all its subdirectories.
Unzipping full projects many times makes them executable which is undersirable if they are only for reading the code or for tests. This util will not work on mounted NTFS that still "insist" to make all files executable.

# Create a script to enable or disable the synaptics touchpad and assign a keyboard shortcut for it.
The big problem with synaptics touchpad that every time I install a Linux distribution on a laptop is now easily removed. A script that enables/disables touchpad is created and assigned to a eyboard shortcut. The user (me) can select which input object is the synaptics before the creation of the script.

# Remove left over, from monodevelop, processes
Apparently monodevelop leaves many mono-sgen processes related to VBCSCompiler. Kill them all using a button.
